### A spec or a specification or a design should be written in plain English before writing software. 

1. Good specs matter
    - For reference 
    - For thoroughness
    - Saves times in large projects

2. What to put in a specs

    - A disclaimer
    - An author. One author
    - Scenarios
    - Nongoals
    - An Overview
    - Details, details, details.
    - Open Issues
    - Side notes
    - Specs Need To Stay Alive

3. Who writes specs -- a program manager or designer or product person

   - Don’t promote a coder to be a program manager with the assumption that their competance is not in English or communication and only coding (Questional assumption)
   - Don’t let the marketing people be program managers with assumption that they are not technical enough (Questional assumption)
   - Don’t have coders report to the program manager because a designer/program-manager can get bossy/short-sighted when in the position of a boss. They spec writer should convince people.

4. Specs don't get read. People ignore specs. So a spec should be 
   - funny
   - writing a spec is like writing code for a brain to execute
   - written as simply as possible
   - reviewed and reread several times

   Templates are harmful. No book or essaes follow a template. A spec is a document that you want people to read. In that way, it is no different than an essay in The New Yorker or a college paper. Have you ever heard of a professor passing out templates for students to write their college papers? Have you ever read two good essays that could be fit into a template? Just drop the idea.
